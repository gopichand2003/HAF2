                  <p>The village of Ingilipaakalanka, located near a serene lake, was home to Venkateshwararao and Raavulamma, a humble couple. Despite their modest means, they were blessed with two sons and two daughters. During that time, medical facilities were scarce, and a cholera epidemic devastated the area, resulting in many children losing their parents and becoming orphans. These children were taken in by Venkateshwararao and Raavulamma, who selflessly cared for them, ensuring they were not left to suffer. I was born as the youngest son into this family. At my birth, the elders were called to perform a ritual, and in accordance with their traditions, I was named Veerabrahmam. From an early age, I was known for my wisdom. However, I used my intelligence to avoid studying, consistently finding ways to escape academic responsibilities. During my childhood, whatever I spoke seemed to manifest, as if my words held power. Although my parents were devoted to idol worship, I could never bring myself to fully accept it, despite the practice being a regular part of our household.</p>

                  <p>The village of Kolletti faced numerous challenges due to its difficult terrain, making agricultural cultivation a struggle. During the harvest season, the region would often flood, rendering travel impossible. In such harsh conditions, my mother fell seriously ill. She sought treatment at numerous hospitals, spending large sums of money, but found no relief. Despite her efforts, her health continued to deteriorate. Eventually, after exhausting all other options, someone suggested to her that if she placed her trust in the Lord, her illness would be healed. Having embraced the fellowship, I underwent a profound spiritual transformation. I invited the servants of God, engaged in fasting, and diligently participated in prayers. I called upon them to preach the Word, and in gratitude, I presented them with offerings, sending them off with joy. For twelve years, I endured the affliction brought on by the illness.</p>

                  <p>During my time at the hostel, I was consistently overwhelmed by deep sorrow and concern for my mother’s health. One evening, after hours of weeping and reflecting on her condition, I fell into a sorrowful sleep. That night, I experienced a vivid and distressing dream. In this dream, my mother had passed away and was placed in a coffin. As the preparations for her burial were underway, I rushed to the scene, crying out in grief. To my astonishment, my mother sat up in the coffin and calmly spoke, saying, “Do not weep, my child. The Lord has called me. I must go, but He will remain with you. Be courageous and do not grieve.” I awoke with a sense of fear and unease, prompting me to immediately make the six-kilometer journey back home. I shared the details of the dream with my family, and we spent the night in mourning together. The following morning, I returned to the hostel.</p>

                  <p>A few days later, while climbing the steps to my classroom, an unexplainable sorrow overtook me. My books slipped from my hands, and I felt a deep, unshakable heaviness in my heart. Unable to focus, I approached some children from my village and anxiously asked about my mother. Their response sent chills through my body—“Everyone from your village is gathered near your house.” I felt a wave of dread wash over me, and my heart raced with the terrifying realization that something terrible had happened. Moments later, my teacher noticed my distress and sent a classmate to call me outside. As I rushed toward my village, I saw my mother’s brother, Bungayya, walking toward me. His eyes were filled with tears. He took a few steps forward, then stopped, hesitated, and turned back. That was the moment I understood—my mother was gone. By the time I reached home, I found that she had already been laid to rest, and my entire family was drowning in grief. I fell to my knees, sobbing uncontrollably, unable to accept the painful truth. Looking at her still face, I saw tears resting on her cheeks, as if she had been crying for me in her final moments. As the funeral rites were performed, a fierce storm broke out, and heavy rain poured down, as if the heavens themselves were mourning with me. That day, a part of me was lost forever.</p>

                  <p>By the time I reached home, I learned that my mother had passed away. She had been laid to rest, and everyone was mourning. The sight of her funeral shattered my heart. Unable to control my grief, I fell to my knees, crying uncontrollably. I saw my mother’s eyes closed, and her tears still flowing, as if she was bidding me farewell with love. It was evident to everyone around that her last moments were filled with deep love for me, her child. Together, we all mourned her passing. The funeral rites were conducted according to Christian traditions, and immediately after, a fierce storm and torrential rain began. As I stood there, crying, fearing that my mother might be exposed to the harsh weather, others also wept loudly and gradually returned to their homes. Losing my mother left me in a state of unbearable sorrow, and it felt as though a storm had swept through my life, leaving it in turmoil. The absence of her love left me feeling only hatred and resentment. During this time, I openly rejected the notion of Jesus Christ as God, speaking harshly and without restraint. Ten days passed before I returned to the hostel, overwhelmed with grief. My friends, having heard of my mother’s passing, tried to console me, offering their support. Despite their kindness, I remained consumed by sorrow.</p>

                  <p>I was never one to shy away from confronting injustice, even when it meant putting my own life at risk. I would stand with my friends to defend women who were being mistreated, and I didn’t hesitate to intervene in matters, even if they didn’t concern me. When it came to doing good, I would unite with hundreds of friends to cooperate in a shared effort. However, I failed to recognize that my actions—although they may have seemed good in the moment—were seen as futile in the eyes of God, much like dirty rags. I didn’t hesitate to face off with rowdy crowds and wrongdoers, even if it meant doing so alone. I wasn't consistent with my academic attendance and often skipped classes. My college life was dominated by a reckless attitude, indulging in six movies a day. I would watch shows at various times—early in the morning, mid-morning, late night, and even the midnight show—before heading back to my dorm. On Sundays, I would visit the beach with my friends. After two years, I returned to my village and became involved in local politics, aligning with a group of supporters.</p>

                  <p>There was a notorious thug in the village, known for his cruelty towards women. No one dared confront him due to his violent nature. The oppressed villagers came to me, sharing their sufferings, and implored me to do something. With a plan in mind, I disguised myself in women's clothing, making sure to present a vulnerable appearance. After walking out of the village, the villagers watched from a distance. As the thug approached me, his intentions clear, my anger and frustration boiled over. In a sudden outburst of rage, I struck him with all my strength, knocking him to the ground. He was left terrified, retreating hastily, and collapsed in the middle of the village, trembling in fear. I then removed the disguise and donned my regular clothes, walking up to him. As he lay on the ground, visibly shaken, he muttered, "Why did you do this? Please leave, don't cause me any more trouble." During one of the summer breaks, when I returned home, I discovered that the house was empty. Dehydrated and weakened by the heat, I collapsed on the bed, feeling faint from hunger. With no one to offer me food or assistance, I fell into a state of melancholy and slept through the afternoon. Around 2 PM, my father returned home, and upon seeing my condition, he prepared a meal for me with a sorrowful heart and served it.</p>

                  <p>While my mother was alive, some of my relatives showed care and support, but after her passing, even the most basic necessities, like preparing a meal, became difficult. Filled with sorrow, I left the village and made my way to my sister's home in Tenali. There, my sister and her husband extended more love and care toward me than they did to their own children, offering me warmth and affection. When the holidays came to an end and I returned to my village, I stood at the train station, tears streaming down my face as I recalled my sister's kindness. As I reached home, I reflected on the challenging circumstances within my family. With no one left to take care of the household, my elder brother had to get married. Despite my rebellious and troublesome behavior, it was my sister-in-law who truly nurtured me, raising me with the same love and care as her own children. In the face of injustice, I, alongside members of my community, took it upon ourselves to challenge any form of wrongdoing, irrespective of the individuals involved. Our primary objective was to confront the increasing prevalence of corruption, bribery, and the manipulation of justice in our locality. Unwilling to tolerate such systemic injustice, we resolved to uphold fairness and integrity, even at the risk of our own safety. During this period, a local arms dealer, familiar with our mission, provided us with two firearms and ammunition, advising us to be resolute in our cause. He emphasized the importance of acting without hesitation, urging us to disregard the potential risks to our lives in the pursuit of justice. At the time, I was merely 19 years old, with the others in the group being older and more experienced. This account reflects the determination to restore justice in the face of systemic corruption, embodying a commitment to confronting oppression and fighting for what is right, regardless of the personal costs.</p>

                  <p>During that period, prayer meetings were organized in our village, and the local pastor, along with prominent members of the community, personally approached me with an invitation to attend. They conveyed with genuine concern, "Babu, your mother had a deep faith in Jesus Christ and devoted herself to Him, ultimately attaining the Kingdom of God. We humbly encourage you to join us in these meetings, where you will have the opportunity to listen to the Word of God and receive spiritual blessings." They expressed that if I agreed to attend, they would be happy to accompany me. Though I initially assured them that I would attend, my inner feelings were resistant, and ultimately, I did not join them in the meetings, even as they left with the hope that I might reconsider.</p>

                  <p>The prayer meetings continued, and the next morning, the pastor, along with other members of the congregation, came to remind me of my commitment to attend. They asked, "Babu, you promised that you would come to the meeting today, didn't you?" Unable to go back on my word, I reluctantly joined them. During the service, the preacher was sharing the Word of God, and in a moment of spiritual conviction, he directed a pointed remark at me, saying, "Brother, be careful! You may be planning something, but God has something greater in store for you." The intensity of his words filled me with frustration. I thought to myself, "Is this how they want to humiliate me just because I agreed to come to their meeting?" My anger began to rise, and I contemplated how I might distance myself from the situation.</p>

                  <p>But as he continued, the preacher said, pointing directly at me, "If you surrender yourself to God, He will elevate you beyond what you ever imagined." At that moment, I questioned the sincerity of his words. I was well aware of my own bad habits, especially my addiction to cigarettes, which I had struggled to give up despite repeated attempts. I had thrown away entire packs of cigarettes only to return and retrieve them later. Even though the consequences of my actions were evident, I had never managed to stop. I thought to myself that this preacher couldn't possibly understand my struggles, and I dismissed his words as empty. However, as he continued to speak, something shifted in my heart.</p>

                  <p>He said, "What I am telling you is the truth. God will change you today if you truly believe." His words began to resonate deeply within me. I started to sense that he was speaking not just from his own perspective, but from God's truth. He emphasized that when he spoke, it was not merely him speaking—God Himself was conveying these words. As the meeting concluded, I hesitated as I was about to leave. I briefly turned back to look at the preacher and wondered if he could offer me guidance to change my life, which had seemed lost. However, the crowd around him made it difficult to approach him directly. I stood there, uncertain, wondering if they would think poorly of me, but I still felt an internal pull to reach out.</p>

                  <p>In that moment, the preacher called out to me, "Hey, come here." I glanced around, unsure if he was speaking to me, but when I saw him gesturing towards me, I hesitated no longer. I approached him, feeling a mix of uncertainty and hope. I shared with the divine servants, "God did not speak to me." In response, they remarked, "Ah, now you're finally in the right mindset." I had prepared my suitcase, planning to leave, and I thought to myself, "This time, I will make sure they know I’m ready." Then one of the divine servants said, "You have confessed the sins you remember, but there are many others that you have forgotten. Ask the Lord to remind you, and He will bring them to your memory." He encouraged me to pray for God's guidance on this matter.</p>

                  <p>I resumed praying earnestly. During my prayer, I felt as though a great noise, like the sound of a train, was approaching me. This disturbance kept recurring, preventing me from continuing my prayer. Curious, I asked the divine servants about the reason behind this. They asked, "Have you ever traveled without a ticket?" Surprised by the question, I admitted that, indeed, I had once traveled from Ponnuru to Tenali without a ticket. The servant immediately asked me to acknowledge this and buy a ticket to make restitution. I followed their guidance and returned to my prayers.</p>

                  <p>As I continued to pray, my past sins began to manifest before my eyes like scenes from a movie reel. I remembered how, during my college days, I would often write very little work but indulge in long, unproductive meals. As these memories played before me, I felt overwhelmed by the revelation, and tears began to fall from my eyes. I finally acknowledged to God, "Yes, I was wrong, and I confess it. I have stolen." With each sin that was revealed, I began to see the truth more clearly. Even though I had never acted inappropriately toward women, the thoughts and intentions I had harbored were far from pure.</p>

                  <p>When God exposed these hidden flaws within me, I wept even more, realizing the depth of my wrongs. The Lord’s Spirit began to work powerfully within me, and I felt the weight of my past mistakes lifting as I came to terms with the reality of my actions. Unknowingly, I wept uncontrollably. I confessed every sin and sought to make amends for all wrongs. Personally and through letters, I asked for forgiveness from those I had wronged. In this manner, I began to realign my heart.</p>

                  <p>One occasion, a farmer asked for prayer support to deal with a pest problem in his field. A prayer group was formed, and we went to his farm, where I was also a part of the group. The prayer leaders called on each person to pray individually, but I wasn't given the opportunity to pray.</p>
                  
                  <p>Later, as we made our way back through the forest to the village, I stopped and prayed in solitude. I prayed, saying, "Lord, I believe You have been with me today. Through these two experiences, I ask You to strengthen me." Afterward, I went to the nearby temple in sorrow.</p>
                  
                  <p>A fellow brother and I were sent to the center. As we walked, we discussed matters about God. That brother said to me, "Brother, these words you're speaking are not yours, but God is speaking through you." At that moment, my soul seemed to ascend into the heavens. My body and the brother were walking on the road, but my soul was up in the sky, looking down.</p>
